Kotlin implementation of the Flutter Engine

**Note:** This project is in the very early stages of development and is being worked on during my free time. Please feel free to contribute.

This is the Engine implementation of Flutter for Kotlin. For the framework (also in early development stages, see here: https://github.com/chRyNaN/klutter). The rough idea is to convert all the Dart code to Kotlin and access the Native code via JNI on Android and using Kotlin Native on iOS.
