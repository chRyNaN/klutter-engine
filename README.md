Kotlin implementation of the Flutter Engine

**Note:** This project is no longer in active development. Kotlin Multiplatform Development is being favored instead.

This project will remain available for anyone who wishes to use it in accordance with it's license. Some of the concepts may be adapted to smaller more focused Kotlin Multplatform Libraries.

**Note:** This project is in the very early stages of development and is being worked on during my free time. Please feel free to contribute.

This is the Engine implementation of Flutter for Kotlin. For the framework (also in early development stages, see here: https://github.com/chRyNaN/klutter). The rough idea is to convert all the Dart code to Kotlin and access the Native code via JNI on Android and using Kotlin Native on iOS. 

Access the Flutter docs and source for more information about the framework: https://github.com/flutter/flutter.
Also, refer to their license that this repo respects: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/LICENSE.
